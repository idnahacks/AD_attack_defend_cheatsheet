# AD_attack_defend_cheatsheet
A list of commands, tools and notes about enumerating and exploiting Active Directory and how to defend against these attacks.

Massive kudos to S1ckB0y1337 as this borrows heavily from the awesome cheatsheet here https://github.com/S1ckB0y1337/Active-Directory-Exploitation-Cheat-Sheet

I have then added my own additionals from the great course taught by Nikhal Mittal http://www.labofapenetrationtester.com/p/about-me.html as well as things I've discovered in my time attacking and defending Active Directory professionally.
